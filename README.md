# Morse Code Decoder

Binary tree-based decoder that translates Morse code sequences into English text.

## Features
- Binary tree implementation for efficient Morse code lookup
- Supports full alphabet and numbers
- O(log n) lookup time complexity
- Handles invalid input and edge cases

## Technical Implementation
- **Language:** Java
- **Data Structure:** Binary Tree
- **Algorithm:** Depth-first traversal

## How to Run
```bash
javac MorseCodeDecoder.java
java MorseCodeDecoder
```

## Example Usage
```
Input: .... . .-.. .-.. ---
Output: HELLO
```
```
